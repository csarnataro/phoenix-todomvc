# TodoMVC with Phoenix 1.7.1
A [TodoMVC](https://www.todomvc.com) implementation in Elixir/Phoenix.

It's mostly compliant with the [TodoMVC specification](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/master/app-spec.md), with some notable exceptions:
- it's not written using a JavaScript framework
- all data is stored in a database instead of the browser's localstorage

## Development
To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
